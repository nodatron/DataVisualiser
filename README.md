# OOP-Assignment
OOP first assignment

In this project I'm using a dataset that contains the top 50 all time PC games according to metacritic.  The data I will be using is critic review score, user review score, game genre, developer, month and year of release.

I plan to make basic graphs showing the difference in the critic review score and the user review score.
I will also be using a few other visualisations(not sure what they are yet) to show the most popular genre of game, most popular developer, most popular month of release.

I may do some cool transitions between the visualizations if i have the time to do them.
