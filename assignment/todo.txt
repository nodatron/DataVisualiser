Assignment is due on the 7th Dec

1. Need to pick a topic for the data visualizations to be on
2. Need to get the data for the visualizations
3. Need to make a few basic visualizations:
		- Trend Graph
		- Bar Chart
		- Pie Chart
4. Make some more interesting visualizations to show a story with the data
		- Average Review Score with the different genres
		- Number of player playing different genres
		- free to play money making compared to pay to play
		- genre pees at certain times of the year
		- Pic times games are bought throughout the year
		- etc....
		- Platform specific buying habits 
		- How games sell on different platforms
		- Esport stats maybe
			- Use different shapes, maybe try 3D
5. Make a menu system for all these visualizations to be seen through
6. Put in some cool animations or transitions between each of the 



Code that can be used later if it is needed
//Populates an ArrayList with data from a file
ArrayList<String> readInForStringArrayList (String filename){
	ArrayList<String> stringal = new ArrayList<String>();
	String[] arr = loadStrings(filename);
	for (String s : arr)
		stringal.add(s);

	return stringal;
}

//Populates an ArrayList with data from a file
ArrayList<Float> readInForFloatArrayList (String filename){
	ArrayList<Float> floatal = new ArrayList<Float>();
	String[] arr = loadStrings(filename);

	for (String s : arr)
		floatal.add(Float.parseFloat(s));

	return floatal;
}
//Populates an ArrayList of ArrayLists with data from a file
ArrayList<ArrayList<Float>> readInForNestedFloatArrayList (String filename){
	ArrayList<ArrayList<Float>> nestedFloatal = new ArrayList<ArrayList<Float>>();
	String[] arr = loadStrings(filename);
	
	for (String s : arr) {
		ArrayList<Float> inner = new ArrayList<Float>();
		String[] innerVals = s.split(",");
		for (String i : innerVals) {
			inner.add(Float.parseFloat(i));
		}
		nestedFloatal.add(inner);
	}

	return nestedFloatal;
}
